              <h2>Stories of Syrian Refugees</h2>
              <p  class="border">After eight years of war, more than half the population of Syria has been forced to flee their homes, with 6.2 million people currently internally displaced and 5.6 million refugees. Many Syrian children have lost a close relative or have a parent or sibling, and thousands have been orphaned or separated from their families in the chaos of war. Many have missed years of education, with 2.1 million children in Syria currently out of school. The conflict has devastated the lives of a generation of young people. Below are stories of Syrian refugee children.</p>

        <h2>Syrian refugees face harsh winter</h2>
        <p>“Winter is very harsh here. Whenever it rains, our homes are flooded,” he says.

          Radwan is among millions of Syrians uprooted by war who face deepening hardship as funding shortfalls threaten the vital relief work of UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and its partners.
          
          Overall, there are more than 5.6 million Syrian refugees registered across the region – </p> 
        <p>2.6 million of whom are children – driven from their homes by a conflict now in its eighth year. And the needs of families are great. Without support people resort to desperate measures such as going without adequate shelter, healthcare or education.</p>

        <h2>Child Refugees</h2>
        <p>Across the globe, nearly 50 million children have been uprooted, forced to flee brutal conflict and extreme poverty. This figure includes millions of children caught in wars in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and South Sudan — and many other countries. This figure also includes</p> 
        <p>children driven from their homes by violence or deprivation and forced to make difficult and dangerous journeys abroad, and children who are out of school and don’t know when they might return.</p>

        <h4>Sabri</h4>
        <p>He fled his home in Aleppo, Syria and is currently living in Paiania, Greece. Sabri shared his story with us through Emfasis, a Greek organization responding to the needs of Syrian refugees in Greece and implementing a photography project to help Syrian children address psychological problems. Sabri is 16 years old.
“I am currently staying at a guesthouse for minors and families in Paiania, just outside Athens, Greece with my family. I’d like to go to Germany. We already know my family and I were granted permission to relocate to a German city. We are hoping to start a new page in our lives. I wish I could make people love each other — that is my dream.”</p>

        <h4>Achan</h4>
        <p>She fled her home in Pajok, South Sudan and is currently living in a refugee camp in Lamwo District, Uganda. Achan’s story was shared with us by Hope Ofiriha, a Norwegian NGO which assists South Sudanese refugees with medical care, microfinance, and education. She is 75 years old.
          Achan is a widow who had eight children. Seven of her children died during the ongoing war in her home country of South Sudan. As a result, she was left with many orphans to take care of. Before the war, she was a peasant farmer in Sudan who cultivated to sustain her big family. When the war broke out in her community, she and her family ran to save their lives, leaving all their belongings behind. She believes her home has been destroyed by the rebels.</p>
